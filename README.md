# WikiScrappingBot
Simple url and text scrapping bot



**link_scrapper.py** : We used a wikipedia page that had listed movies as links in alphabetical order. We scrapped all the links and stored the to .txt file so the text_scrapper can scrape the text of them. 

**text_scrapper.py**: It uses the names of the movies we stores previously and it scrapes all the text(<p> tags)  from each article from wikipedia. Stores the data to txt files so we can create the index we need for our search engine project.

Used for the creation of a movie data corpus from wikipedia articles ,in purpose of an information retrieval project
